## Status: experimental ⚠️

OSC and Ble Midi to I2c for Er-301, Txo etc

Although it is functional and used on a daily basis, this project/experiment is still a work in progress and is published here as a "proof of concept" and not as a set of instructions to follow.  
Unless you really know what you're doing, this project requires the "Hans hat" created specifically and a RPI Zero W, you should avoid trying to install anything if you're not sure. The code is still very rough. 
Consult the tracker.md in the docs if you're curious and feel free to contact me if you wish to help.

More infos coming soon.
