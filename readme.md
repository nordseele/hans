⚠️ **This project is experimental and is still being developed and tested**

❌ An issue prevents the ER-301 from booting up normally if both the Raspberry Pi and the ER-301 aren't started simultaneously (see "known issues" below). Until an hardware solution is created, it is recommended to avoid connecting the ER-301 to the i2c bus. 

The app itself won't damage the modules but if you mess up the wiring between the RPi and the Eurorack modules, you may seriously damage them. Do it at your own risk.
